# Contributing to Owork

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Owork! We welcome contributions from the community to help make Owork even better.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository to your GitHub account.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/odilonv/Owork.git
    ```

3. Create a new branch for your contribution:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/odilonv/Owork.git
    ```

4. Make your changes and commit them:

    git commit -m "Add new feature"

5. Push the changes to your forked repository:
    git push origin feature/new-feature

    5. Open a pull request from your forked repository to the original repository.




Follow these steps to add a new route to the Owork application:

1. Run the generator using the following command:

    ```bash
    dart run build_runner watch
    ```
Use the `[watch]` flag to continuously monitor the file system for edits and automatically rebuild as necessary.

2. If you prefer the generator to run once and exit, you can use the following command:
   
    ```bash
    dart run build_runner watch
    ```
