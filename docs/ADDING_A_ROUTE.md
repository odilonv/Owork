# Adding a Route Tutorial

Follow these steps to add a new route to the Owork application:

1. Run the generator using the following command:

    ```bash
    dart run build_runner watch
    ```
    Use the `[watch]` flag to continuously monitor the file system for edits and automatically rebuild as necessary.

2. If you prefer the generator to run once and exit, you can use the following command:
   
    ```bash
    dart run build_runner watch
    ```
