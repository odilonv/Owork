# Owork

Owork is a cross-platform mobile application developed in Dart using Flutter. The primary purpose of this application is to facilitate the Pomodoro technique while incorporating adaptive Pomodoros based on your progress. Additionally, Owork includes a feature to track your work time.

## Features

- **Pomodoro Timer**: Utilize the Pomodoro technique for efficient time management and increased productivity.
- **Adaptive Pomodoros**: Benefit from adaptive Pomodoros that adjust based on your progress, ensuring a personalized and effective work rhythm.
- **Work Time Tracker**: Keep track of your working hours to gain insights into your productivity and time management habits.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to add a new route to the Owork application:

1. Run the generator using the following command:

   ```bash
   dart run build_runner watch
   ```
Use the [watch] flag to continuously monitor the file system for edits and automatically rebuild as necessary.

2. If you prefer the generator to run once and exit, you can use the following command:
   
   ```bash
   dart run build_runner watch
   ```
